# Tool Calling Enhancement - Complete Summary

## Problem Analysis
The user reported that despite conversation containing clear user preferences ("anh thích ăn mặn"), the agent wasn't calling the `save_user_preference_with_refresh_flag` tool, and requested comparison with the original `save_user_preference` tool.

## Root Cause Identified
The enhanced tool (`save_user_preference_with_refresh_flag`) had insufficient description/docstring compared to the original tool:

**Original tool description:**
- ✅ Clear "When to use" section: "When the user provides new information about their preferences, habits, or interests"
- ✅ Detailed guidance for LLM tool selection
- ✅ Comprehensive parameter descriptions

**Enhanced tool (before fix):**
- ❌ Very brief, generic description
- ❌ No clear usage triggers for LLM
- ❌ Missing Vietnamese examples

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Tool Description ✅
Updated `src/tools/enhanced_memory_tools.py` with comprehensive description:

```python
save_user_preference_with_refresh_flag.description = (
    "Save user preference information and automatically refresh user profile. "
    "This tool stores user preferences, habits, or personal information in their memory profile "
    "and signals that the user profile needs to be refreshed for immediate availability. "
    
    "Use this tool when: "
    "When the user provides new information about their preferences, habits, or interests; "
    "When user mentions likes/dislikes about food, drinks, atmosphere, service; "
    # ... (full detailed description with Vietnamese examples)
)
```

### 2. Key Improvements Made ✅
- **Clear trigger keywords**: "thích", "yêu thích", "ưa", "thường", "hay", "luôn", "muốn", "sinh nhật"
- **Vietnamese examples**: "User says 'Tôi thích ăn cay' → preference_type='food_preference', preference_value='cay'"
- **Comprehensive usage scenarios**: food preferences, dietary restrictions, group sizes, occasions, etc.
- **Parameter clarity**: Detailed explanation of `preference_type` categories

### 3. System Prompt Already Comprehensive ✅
The `DirectAnswerAssistant` system prompt already contains:

```
🧠 **TOOL CALLS - BẮT BUỘC THỰC HIỆN (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
**⚠️ MANDATORY RULES FOR ALL INTERACTIONS:**
1. **SCAN FOR PREFERENCES FIRST:** Every user message MUST be scanned for preferences, habits, or desires
2. **DETECT KEYWORDS:** 'thích'(like), 'yêu thích'(love), 'ưa'(prefer), 'thường'(usually), 'hay'(often), 'luôn'(always), 'muốn'(want), 'sinh nhật'(birthday)
3. **MANDATORY TOOL CALL:** When ANY keyword detected → MUST call `save_user_preference_with_refresh_flag` tool
```

### 4. Collection Configuration Already Correct ✅
Verified that `app.py` uses correct collection configuration:
- ✅ Uses `MARKETING_DOMAIN["collection_name"]` 
- ✅ MARKETING_DOMAIN configured with `"collection_name": "aladin_maketing"`
- ✅ Matches the marketing domain for restaurant searches

## Testing Results ✅

```bash
# Tool execution successful
✅ Tool execution successful:
   Result type: <class 'dict'>
   Result: {'message': 'Saved food_preference for user test_user_123: ...', 'user_profile_needs_refresh': True}
✅ Refresh flag is properly set

# Enhanced tool description now comprehensive
Enhanced tool description: Save user preference information and automatically refresh user profile. 
This tool stores user preferences... Use this tool when: When the user provides new information about 
their preferences, habits, or interests... Examples: User says 'Tôi thích ăn cay' → 
preference_type='food_preference', preference_value='cay'...
```

## Next Steps - Action Required 🚨

### 1. Restart Server (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Stop current server
# Restart to load improved tool descriptions
cd "d:\Project\chatbot_aladin\chatbot_server"
python app.py
```

### 2. Test User Preference Detection
Test with messages containing preferences:
- "Tôi thích ăn cay" 
- "Anh thích ăn mặn"
- "Tôi thường đặt bàn 6 người"
- "Hôm nay sinh nhật con tôi"

### 3. Monitor Logs
Check for tool calling logs:
- `🔥🔥🔥 SAVE_USER_PREFERENCE_WITH_REFRESH_FLAG ĐƯỢC GỌI! 🔥🔥🔥`
- Tool parameter logging for debugging

### 4. Redis Setup (Pending)
Still need to complete Redis Docker setup:
```powershell
# Try one of these solutions:
docker logout
# OR verify email and retry
# OR use Redis on WSL
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. ✅ User says "Tôi thích ăn cay" → Tool automatically called
2. ✅ Tool saves preference with refresh flag
3. ✅ User profile immediately refreshed for next interaction
4. ✅ No visible tool calling to user (happens in background)
5. ✅ Better personalization in subsequent responses

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test tool properties
python debug_tool_properties.py

# Check server health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# View logs during conversation
tail -f log.text
```

The enhanced tool now has description parity with the original tool and should properly trigger on user preference statements. The comprehensive system prompt combined with detailed tool descriptions should resolve the tool calling issue.
